This is a revision of my earlier external ballistics script, rewritten entirely in the Julia programming language, and utilizing a Vern9 ODE solver.

# To-Do
Higher-order gravity terms using automatic differentiation.

# Sources
In addition to any sources cited on my previous project, I utilized Vincenty's 1975 paper, in addition to SciML's DifferentialEquations.jl package, in addition to the Plots.jl, AstroTime.jl, and Interpolations.jl packages.
